# Problem Statement: Investing capital

---

## 1. Customer Definition

An owner of personal capital who wants that capital to compound in real purchasing power over time—while minimizing loss, minimizing the cognitive burden of the process, and not materially underperforming achievable alternatives.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Personal capital must be allocated—there is no "do nothing" option, as even holding cash is a choice with consequences.

Every allocation exposes the owner to three irreducible pains:
- **Loss of Capital** — the possibility of ending with less than you started
- **Cognitive Requirement** — the mental work the process demands
- **Forgone Returns** — underperformance relative to alternatives that were available

These pains cannot be eliminated. They can only be minimized, or traded off against each other. The problem persists as long as capital exists.

*This problem statement reflects conditions as of 2025. The mechanisms that produce these pains—particularly those related to effort and information processing—may be altered by advances in artificial intelligence or other technologies.*

## 3. Pain Points

All investment pain reduces to three irreducible categories:

### 3.1 Loss of Capital

*Permanent destruction of wealth—ending with less than you started, in real purchasing power terms.*

Sources of loss of capital include but are not limited to:

**Market-driven destruction:**

- Broad market declines (crashes, bear markets, prolonged downturns) that exceed the investor's holding capacity
- Sector or asset class collapses (bubbles bursting, industries becoming obsolete)

**Security-driven destruction:**

- Price declines in single investments made 
- Individual position failures (bankruptcy, fraud, competitive destruction of single holdings)

**Forced crystallization:**
- Liquidity needs compelling sale at depressed prices
- Margin calls requiring liquidation at worst possible moments

**External shocks:**

- Geopolitical events (war, sanctions, expropriation, nationalization)
- Regulatory changes that destroy value (bans, retroactive taxation, rule changes)
- Currency devaluation or collapse affecting holdings

**Counterparty and system failures:**

- Broker, custodian, or exchange bankruptcy or fraud
- Platform outages preventing action during critical moments
- Cybersecurity breaches and theft

**Erosion (loss without dramatic event):**
- Inflation destroying purchasing power while nominal value appears stable
- Fees and costs exceeding nominal returns, producing real loss

**Behavioral self-destruction:**
- Panic selling that converts temporary drawdowns into permanent losses
- Revenge trading or doubling down that compounds losses
- Excessive leverage or concentration that enables total wipeout

---

### 3.2 Cognitive Requirement

*The mental work, time, attention, and emotional energy the process demands—which must be spent regardless of outcome.*

Sources of cognitive requirement include but are not limited to:

**Learning burden:**
- Acquiring foundational knowledge (financial concepts, instruments, market mechanics)
- Staying current as markets, regulations, and technology evolve
- Learning from mistakes, which requires honest post-mortem analysis

**Analytical burden:**
- Evaluating investments across multiple dimensions (business quality, valuation, risk, timing)
- Assessing risk—both quantifiable and unquantifiable
- Comparing alternatives to determine relative attractiveness
- Distinguishing signal from noise in an adversarial information environment

**Decision burden:**
- Choosing under irreducible uncertainty (outcomes unknowable at decision time)
- Sizing positions (how much to allocate given conviction and risk)
- Timing entries and exits (or deciding not to time)
- Resolving conflicting information and frameworks

**Monitoring burden:**
- Tracking positions and portfolio performance
- Watching for thesis-changing developments
- Managing ongoing processes (rebalancing, tax optimization, record-keeping)

**Evaluation burden:**
- Assessing whether your process is working (difficult given noise and luck)
- Separating skill from luck in your own results
- Judging intermediaries—determining who, if anyone, to trust

**Emotional burden:**
- Managing fear, greed, regret, envy, and anxiety as they arise
- Maintaining discipline when it feels wrong
- Tolerating unresolved uncertainty over long time horizons

**Opportunity cost:**
- Time spent on investing is unavailable for other purposes
- Mental bandwidth consumed reduces capacity for other pursuits
- The process competes with life—career, family, health, interests

**Perpetuity:**
- The work has no completion; it continues as long as capital exists
- Changing circumstances (personal, market, regulatory) require continuous adaptation

---

### 3.3 Forgone Returns

*The gap between returns actually earned and returns that were available from known alternatives—measurable in hindsight.*

Sources of forgone returns include but are not limited to:

**Selection gaps:**
- Choosing assets that underperformed alternatives that were available and accessible
- Failing to own what performed well, when it was identifiable as an option
- Holding positions that underperformed while better options existed

**Timing gaps:**
- Entering too late (after gains already captured by others)
- Exiting too early (before further gains materialized)
- Holding too long (staying past the point when exit was optimal)
- Waiting too long (cash drag while opportunities existed)

**Sizing gaps:**
- Under-allocating to positions that performed best
- Over-allocating to positions that performed worst
- Position sizes that didn't reflect conviction or risk-adjusted opportunity

**Friction gaps:**
- Paying higher fees than necessary (when lower-cost alternatives existed)
- Tax inefficiency (when better tax management was available)
- Transaction costs from activity that didn't add value
- Cash drag from uninvested balances

**Behavioral gaps:**
- Chasing past performance into overvalued assets
- Selling during temporary declines that subsequently recovered
- Overtrading—activity that reduced returns vs. holding still
- Herding into crowded, lower-expected-return positions

**Information gaps:**
- Acting without information that was publicly available
- Misinterpreting information that was correctly understood by others
- Analytical errors that a more careful process would have avoided

**Structural gaps:**
- Diversification necessarily diluting winners with average performers
- Access constraints (regulatory, platform, minimums) preventing optimal allocation

## 4. Problem Frequency

**Exposure is continuous; required attention is variable.**

As long as capital exists, it is exposed to the three pains. Loss can occur at any moment. Forgone returns accrue continuously. The cognitive burden depends on the approach taken—it may be continuous, periodic, or front-loaded.

Circumstances change—markets move, life evolves, regulations shift—which may alter exposure or invalidate prior approaches. The problem does not disappear, but how much attention it demands is a function of how it is addressed.

## 5. Desired State

The desired state has four irreducible components:

**Wealth compounds.** Capital grows in real purchasing power over time. Losses are minimized. Catastrophic, unrecoverable loss is avoided. The mathematics of compounding work for the owner, not against them.

**Returns are competitive.** Performance does not materially trail alternatives that were available. The owner does not suffer persistent, avoidable underperformance. There is no deep regret from obvious misallocation.

**The process is light.** The approach demands minimal *required* time, attention, effort, and emotional energy. It is sustainable indefinitely—it does not require heroic effort, constant vigilance, or sacrifice of life outside investing. Participation is optional, not mandatory—available for those who want it, but not imposed on those who don't.

**Confidence is justified.** The owner can verify that the above three outcomes are being achieved. Trust is earned through transparency and evidence, not required as blind faith. Peace of mind comes from knowledge, not hope.

## 6. Root Cause Analysis

The following are potential root causes of the three pains. This list may not be exhaustive.

---

### RC1: The Future Is Unknowable

Investment outcomes depend on events that haven't happened yet. The future is not merely unknown—it is unknowable in principle. This is not a limitation that can be overcome through better data, models, or computation. It is an inherent feature of complex systems with randomness and reflexivity. No amount of intelligence or processing power makes the future predictable with certainty.

---

### RC2: Markets Are Adversarial and Zero-Sum

Markets are competitive arenas where participants' interests conflict. For every dollar of outperformance, another dollar must underperform—this is arithmetic, not behavior. This zero-sum structure creates adversarial dynamics: counterparties have opposing interests, intermediaries may profit from your suboptimal actions, and information sources may be designed to mislead rather than inform. Trust must be verified, not assumed.

---

### RC3: Markets Are Reflexive

Participants' beliefs affect prices. Prices affect fundamentals. Fundamentals affect beliefs. This creates feedback loops where the act of prediction changes what is being predicted. Positions can become self-fulfilling or self-defeating. Crowded trades are dangerous. Equilibrium is the exception, not the rule. The observer is always part of the system being observed.
