## Summary

| # | Constraint | Treatment |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Must be implementable by a startup of 5-10 people significantly augmented by AI | HARD |
| 2 | Must be a digital solution that can be built remotely | HARD |
| 3 | Crypto-native | SOFT |
| 4 | Prefer less regulated markets | SOFT |
| 5 | Prefer solutions achievable with moderate starting capital | SOFT |

## Constraint 1
- **Constraint:** Must be implementable by a startup of 5-10 people significantly augmented by AI
- **Rationale:** The solution must be executable by a small, AI-augmented team rather than requiring institutional scale, large headcount, or capabilities only available to established financial institutions

---

## Constraint 2
- **Constraint:** Must be a digital solution that can be built remotely
- **Rationale:** Digital solutions are efficient and our team is remote-first

---

## Constraint 3
- **Constraint:** Crypto-native—prefer solutions built on or around crypto/blockchain infrastructure and markets
- **Rationale:** Crypto markets offer structural advantages including 24/7 operation, programmability, transparency, global access, and reduced intermediary dependence that may enable novel approaches

---

## Constraint 4
- **Constraint:** Prefer less regulated markets where a broader range of activities are permitted
- **Rationale:** Reduced regulatory constraints expand the solution space; strategies that would be prohibited or require extensive licensing in traditional finance may be permissible in crypto, offshore, and other less regulated venues

---

## Constraint 5
- **Constraint:** Prefer solutions achievable with moderate starting capital ($10,000–$1,000,000 range)
- **Rationale:** Most personal capital falls in this range; however, this can be relaxed if scale-dependent elements can be adapted or phased
