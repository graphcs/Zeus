<!--  4 TREATMENT OPTIONS per MoSCoW framework:
MUST: Non-negotiable. The solution fails without this.
SHOULD: Important, but solution could work without it.
COULD: Nice-to-have. Include if resources allow. 
WONT: Explicitly out of scope for this solution. --> 

<!--  GUIDANCE: Each objective should be specific, measurable or observable, and relevant to the problem. Quantify success indicators where possible; otherwise describe how success will be recognized. Add or remove objective sections as needed. For WONT items, Success Indicator can be left blank or marked "N/A". -->

## Objective 1

- **Objective:** Preserve capital first, then maximize returns—protect against unrecoverable losses that impair long-term compounding, then grow wealth as aggressively as possible within that constraint
- **Success Indicator:** Wealth compounds over time; drawdowns remain bounded and recoverable; no single position or event capable of causing permanent impairment; the approach does not depend on favorable conditions to avoid disaster; poor outcomes are bounded, not unbounded. Any losses should trend to zero as a percentage of total capital managed

------

## Objective 2

- **Objective:** Minimize forgone returns—reduce underperformance relative to the maximum return achievable within the solution's defined opportunity set. The opportunity set is deliberately constrained to a bounded pool of assets, instruments, and trading strategies; within that pool, a theoretical maximum return exists and serves as the benchmark. The gap between achieved returns and this benchmark should narrow over time. The opportunity set may expand incrementally as mastery is demonstrated, but the benchmark is always defined relative to the current pool, not to all publicly available alternatives. The long term objective, is to expand to all publicly tradeable alternatives.
- **Success Indicator:** The gap between achieved returns and the maximum achievable within the defined pool narrows over time; selection, timing, sizing, and execution decisions do not systematically leave value on the table; errors are identified, understood, and trend toward zero; when the opportunity set expands, benchmark comparisons adjust accordingly; performance is measured against what was achievable given the constraints, not against hypothetical omniscience

------

## Objective 3

- **Objective:** Build the solution from first principles—fundamental truths that remain stable over time—to ensure durability, robustness, and bottoms-up coherence
- **Success Indicator:** Every major design decision traces back to one or more identified first principles or combinations thereof; the solution logic is robust in time; the solution logic does not depend on temporary market conditions, specific technologies, or tactics that may change over time; the approach remains valid even as surface-level conditions evolve

------

## Objective 4

- **Objective:** Incorporate secrets—non-obvious truths not widely known, believed, or acted upon—as the foundation for creating a solution that is genuinely new and structurally distinct from existing approaches. Secrets are the mechanism; differentiation is the outcome. Secrets are truths that, when articulated, would be dismissed or disputed by most market participants—not merely obscure facts, but beliefs that require conviction to act upon. Maintain the capacity to continuously discover and integrate new secrets as old ones become widely known and new ones emerge. Secrets may be incorporated in any aspect or dimension of the solution, but should only be incorporated when they provide an edge or advantage over non-secrets. Consider secrets provided, propose additional secrets from your own knowledge, and develop new secrets from observation and logical reasoning. All secrets incorporated—including their source (provided, discovered, or developed)—should be clearly outlined
- **Success Indicator:** The solution represents a "Zero to One" innovation—creating genuinely new value rather than incremental improvements on existing approaches (One to N). It is hard to replicate, provides structural advantages, and delivers performance meaningfully better than existing solutions—ideally at least 10x better across the dimensions that matter most to achieving the objectives, whether through one transformative advantage or compounding improvements across multiple areas. The solution occupies a distinct position rather than competing head-on with established alternatives. Differentiation is defensible precisely because it stems from secrets rather than execution alone. The solution includes mechanisms for recognizing when existing secrets have lost their value (i.e., when others have discovered and acted on the same truths, eroding the advantage) and for continuously discovering or developing new secrets over time to sustain the edge

------

## Objective 5

- **Objective:** Start with a narrow, well-defined domain and achieve mastery before expanding scope—depth before breadth. Begin with a constrained set of assets, strategies, or decisions where full understanding and reliable edge are achievable, then expand incrementally only after demonstrating consistent performance and extracting available value from the current domain
- **Success Indicator:** The initial scope is deliberately bounded and small enough to master fully; performance within that scope is strong before any expansion occurs; expansion is driven by evidence of mastery rather than ambition or boredom; at each stage, the solution dominates its chosen domain rather than competing marginally across many; complexity and breadth grow only as competence justifies

------

## Objective 6

- **Objective:** Improve and adapt over time—the solution gets better as experience accumulates, remains effective as conditions change, and can be revised as understanding develops without starting over
- **Success Indicator:** The solution itself as well as the returns it produces improve over successive periods through observation, learning, self-critique, validation / invalidation, evolution, et cetera. 

------

## Objective 7

- **Objective:** Minimize required human cognitive burden—the process demands minimal time, attention, effort, and emotional energy and is sustainable indefinitely
- **Success Indicator:** Required decision-making is infrequent and bounded; no urgent actions demanded by market movements; process does not require constant vigilance or sacrifice of life outside investing

------

## Objective 8

- **Objective:** Prefer simplicity—when multiple approaches achieve equivalent outcomes, choose the simpler one
- **Success Indicator:** Fewer moving parts over more; complexity justifies itself by enabling outcomes simpler approaches cannot achieve

------

## Objective 9

- **Objective:** Accept human input—the solution is capable of taking in human suggestions and feedback to improve its performance
- **Success Indicator:** Human insights, observations, and corrections can be incorporated to improve the overall solution, getting the best performance by combing the best of what machines and humans contribute respectively; the solution is not impervious to external guidance

------

## Objective 10

- **Objective:** Provide transparency—confidence is earned through evidence rather than required as blind faith
- **Success Indicator:** Current state, performance, and evolutions are visible, verifiable, and tracked; the logic of the approach is explainable; no elements require trust without the possibility of verification
