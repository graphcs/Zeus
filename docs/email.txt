Design Brief. Explanation of what we'd like Zeus to do at a high level in plain English: a generalized, production-grade multi-agent system for solving arbitrary problems. Specifies the inputs (problem statement, constraints, prior solutions), outputs (solution, confidence score, tradeoff analysis, reasoning trace), and high-level system requirements.
Target Solution. We gave Claude/ChatGPT the Design Brief along with behavioral guidelines and it designed this Target Solution as the "optimal" target solution to the Design Brief. We did some validation of it with a validator agent (manually built) and this solution was not surpassed. It may not be optimal, it may be overbuilt - we will find out over time.
MVP. We MVP'ed the target solution to reduce time-to-ship, complexity, risk. This is what we should start with, unless you see it differently.
Cover note. A brief executive summary from a technical developer handoff perspective, clarifying what V0 success looks like, what's explicitly out of scope (latency optimization, enterprise governance), and the expected deliverables.
Invariants and Guardrails. The non-negotiable rules that must hold for every V0 run: critique is mandatory, traceability via RunRecord, transparency fields always present, budget enforcement, and graceful degradation on failures.
Example Runs / Golden Scenarios. Seven behavioral test cases (API design, conflicting constraints, structured JSON output, under-specified requirements, etc.) defining expected system properties for acceptance testing and regression anchoring.
Roadmap MVP to Target Solution. The evolution plan from V0 through V7, showing how the bounded solver grows into a full governed multi-agent system with evaluation ledgers, regression guards, tool gateways, and task graphs.
