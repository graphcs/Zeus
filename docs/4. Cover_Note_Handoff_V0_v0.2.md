# Cover Note — Handoff Package (V0 Bounded Critique‑Led Solver)

We are building **V0: Bounded Critique‑Led Solver** — a baseline pipeline that maximizes **coverage, explicit uncertainty, debuggability, and learning signal** under bounded iteration.

## What success means (V0)
- Multi‑view critique on every run
- Explicit assumptions + known issues in every response
- RunRecord persisted with artifacts + provenance
- Bounded iteration (≤1 revision) and explicit budgets

## What is intentionally *not* the focus
- “Fast answering” as a primary KPI (latency/cost are constraints, not the objective)
- enterprise governance / policy engines
- enforced regression guards (blocking)
- complex orchestration / branching task graphs
- external tool gateways

## Contract
Please treat **System Invariants** as non‑negotiable. Implementation choices are intentionally open.

## Deliverable expectation
A working `/solve` (and/or CLI) that:
- always runs multi‑view critique
- performs ≤1 revision
- returns `final_answer`, `assumptions[]`, `known_issues[]`, `run_id`
- persists a `RunRecord` with provenance

If you believe any invariant should change, propose an alternative with rationale and impact on the roadmap.
